## Open Portfolio - Investments Portfolio Kotlin CLI

A small project I did to be able to see my portfolio in a Terminal window.

The scraper uses a Chrome Driver with Selenium in order to navigate and scrape the webpages.

The `PortfolioScraper` class is abstract and can be implemented for additional websites/platforms.

## Installation Guide
